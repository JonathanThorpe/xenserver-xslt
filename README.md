# XenServer XSLT Template

An XSLT Stylesheet for interpreting the XenServer XAPI Database.

Originally based on my work at Citrix in 2010, this repository contains amendments to reflect changes in how XAPI stores data. This version is designed to work with XenServer 6.5, but may work with earlier and later releases with varying degrees of success.
